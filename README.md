# Awesant

Awesant is a simple log shipper for logstash. It ships logs from multiple inputs to multiple outputs.

## Plugins and Options

Global options for each plugin:

* <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/GlobalOptions.md>

Currently supported inputs:

* File: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/InputFileOptions.md>
* Socket: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/InputSocketOptions.md>

Currently supported outputs:

* Redis: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputRedisOptions.md>
* RabbitMQ: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputRabbitmqOptions.md>
* Screen: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputScreenOptions.md>
* Socket: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputSocketOptions.md>

## Pre-installation

Awesant is written in Perl. So you have to install some Perl packages at first
to run Awesant on your machine. Let us have a look at what you need to install:

    Class::Accessor
    Log::Handler
    Params::Validate
    IO::Socket
    IO::Select
    Sys::Hostname
    Time::HiRes
    JSON

If you want to transport logs via SSL and the Socket output then you need to install IO::Socket::SSL.

If you want to transport logs to RabbitMQ you need to install Net::RabbitMQ.

You can install the packages with your favorite package manager, or from CPAN.

    cpan -i Log::Handler
    cpan -i Params::Validate
    cpan -i ...

## Installation

Just download the project and execute

    perl Configure.PL
    make
    make install

Or create an RPM with

    VERSION=v0.10
    git clone https://github.com/bloonix/awesant.git
    cd awesant
    git checkout $VERSION
    tar -czf awesant-$version.tar.gz awesant-$version
    rpmbuild -ta awesant-$version.tar.gz
    rpm -i rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/awesant...

Or create a deb-package with

## Install Awesant from a repository

You can install Awesant from the Bloonix repository if you like.
The packages are available for Debian and CentOS like distributions.
Just look into the INSTALL files on http://download.bloonix.de/.

## HowTo

### Start and stop Awesant

    /etc/init.d/awesant-agent [ start | stop | restart ]

### Configuration

The main configuration file of the Awesant agent is

    /etc/awesant/agent.conf

The configuration style is very simple. You can define inputs, outputs, a logger and some global configuration parameters.

Inputs are the log files you want to ship. Outputs are the transports you want to use to ship the log files.

Example configuration:

    # Print some statistics to the log file.
    # Default: no
    #benchmark yes

    # How often to poll inputs for new events.
    # Default: 500 (ms)
    #poll 500

    # How many lines to request from the inputs by each poll.
    # Default: 100 (count)
    #lines 100

    # How does poll and lines work in combination?
    # If 100 lines could be read then the agent tries to read the next 100 lines.
    # If less than 100 lines could be read then the end of the log file was reached
    # and the agent waits 500 ms before the agent tries to read the next lines.

    input {
        file {
            type syslog
            path /var/log/messages
            tags tag1, tag2
            add_field key1, value1, key2, value2
            # add_field {
            #    key1 value1
            #    key2 value2
            # }
        }
    }

    output {
        redis {
            type syslog
            key syslog
            host 127.0.0.1
            port 6379
            database 0
            timeout 10
            password foobared
        }
        screen {
            type syslog
            send_to stdout
        }
    }

    logger {
        file {
            filename /var/log/awesant/agent.log
            maxlevel info
        }
    }

With this agent configuration your logstash should be configured as follows:

    input {
        redis {
            host => "127.0.0.1"
            port => 6379
            data_type => "list"
            db => 0
            key => "syslog"
            type => "redis"
            format => "json_event"
        }
    }

### Extended input and output configuration

* It is possible to set a comma separated list of types for outputs.
* It is possible to set wildcards for file inputs.
* It is possible to set a wildcard as output type.
* If a wildcard is used then Awesant will watch the glob pattern for new files.
* If a new file is created then Awesant will tail the new file automatically, so you do not need to restart the service.

As example if you have different inputs, such as

    input {
        file {
            type apache-access-log
            path /var/log/httpd/*access*log
        }
        file {
            type syslog
            path /var/log/messages
        }
    }

then you can use one output for multiple inputs:

    output {
        redis {
            type apache-access-log, syslog
            key logstash
            host 127.0.0.1
        }
    }

In this case the redis-output is bound to the inputs 'apache-access-log'
and 'syslog'.

If you want to match all input types you can use a wildcard as output type:

    output {
        redis {
            type *      # match all input types
            key logstash
            host 127.0.0.1
        }
    }

When the log events are pushed to the output the type of the input is used for
the JSON event. This means that '@type' is set to the type of the input, not of
the output.

# SSL and authentication support

Do you want to ship your logs via SSL and via password authentication? That should not be a problem.

The scenario could looks like

    Awesant output socket -> Awesant input socket -> Redis -> Logstash

You can use the script 'awesant-create-cert' to create a cert bundle for Awesant.
This should be run from the machine where the redis and the input socket is to be run.

    awesant-create-cert /etc/awesant 4096 10000

You should now copy the /etc/awesant/certs/ca.crt to /etc/awesant/certs/ca.crt
on any of the log shipping machines you wish to configure.

    scp /etc/awesant/certs/ca.crt root@logshippingnode:/etc/awesant/certs/

## Awesant output socket

Create the following configuration on the machines with the log files you want to ship.

    input {
        file {
            type foologs
            path /var/log/foo/*.log
        }
        file {
            type barlogs
            path /var/log/bar/*.log
        }
    }

    output {
        socket {
            type foologs, barlogs
            host redis-machine-remote-addr
            port 25801
            auth your-very-very-very-long-password
            ssl_ca_file /etc/awesant/certs/ssl.crt
            # This should be on by default, but we set it to be safe.
            ssl_verify_mode SSL_VERIFY_PEER
        }
    }

## Awesant input socket

Create the following configuration on the machine where the redis instance is running
or on any host to transfer the logs to redis.

    input {
        socket {
            type logstash
            host redis-machine-local-addr
            port 25801
            auth your-very-very-very-long-password
            ssl_cert_file /etc/awesant/certs/ssl.crt
            ssl_key_file  /etc/awesant/certs/ssl.key
            format json_event
            workers 10
        }
    }

    output {
        redis {
            type foologs, barlogs
            host 127.0.0.1
            port 6379
            database 0
            key logstash
        }
    }
