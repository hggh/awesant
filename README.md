# Awesant

Awesant is a simple log shipper for logstash. It ships logs from multiple inputs to multiple outputs.

## Pre-installation

Awesant is written in Perl. So you have to install some Perl packages at first
to run Awesant on your machine. Let us have a look on what you need to install:

    Log::Handler
    Params::Validate
    IO::Socket
    IO::Select
    Sys::Hostname
    Time::HiRes
    JSON

If you want to transport logs via SSL and the Socket output then you need to install IO::Socket::SSL as well.

You can install the packages with your favorite package manager or with cpan tool.

    cpan -i Log::Handler
    cpan -i Params::Validate
    cpan -i ...

## Installation

Just download the project and execute

    perl Configure.PL
    make
    make install

Or create a RPM with

    rpmbuild -ta awesant-$version.tar.gz
    rpm -i rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/awesant...

## Install awesant from a repository

You can install awesant from the Bloonix repository if you like.
The packages are available for Debian and CentOS like distributions.
Just look into the INSTALL files on http://download.bloonix.de/.

## HowTo

### Start and stop Awesant

    /etc/init.d/awesant-agent [ start | stop | restart ]

### Configuration

The main configuration file of the Awesant agent is

    /etc/awesant/agent.conf

The configuration style is very simple. You can define inputs, outputs, a logger and some global configuration parameter.

Inputs are the log files you want to ship. Outputs are the transports you want to use to ship the log files.

Currently supported inputs:

* File: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/InputFileOptions.md>
* Socket: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/InputSocketOptions.md>

Currently supported outputs:

* Redis: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputRedisOptions.md>
* Screen: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputScreenOptions.md>
* Socket: <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/OutputSocketOptions.md>

Global configuration options:

* <https://github.com/bloonix/awesant/blob/master/GlobalOptions.md>

Example configuration:

    # How often to poll inputs for new events.
    # Default: 500 (ms)
    poll 500

    # How much lines to request from the inputs by each poll.
    # Default: 100 (count)
    lines 100

    input {
        file {
            type syslog
            path /var/log/messages
            tags tag1, tag2
            add_field key1, value1, key2, value2
            # add_field {
            #    key1 value1
            #    key2 value2
            # }
        }
    }

    output {
        redis {
            type syslog
            key syslog
            host 127.0.0.1
            port 6379
            database 0
            timeout 10
            password foobared
        }
        screen {
            type syslog
            send_to stdout
        }
    }

    logger {
        file {
            filename /var/log/awesant/agent.log
            maxlevel info
        }
    }

With this agent configuration your logstash should be configured as follows:

    input {
        redis {
            host => "127.0.0.1"
            port => 6379
            data_type => "list"
            db => 0
            key => "syslog"
            type => "redis"
            format => "json_event"
        }
    }

### Extended input and output configuration

* It is possible to set a comma separated list of types for outputs.
* It is possible to set wildcards for file inputs.

As example if you has different inputs, such as

    input {
        file {
            type apache-access-log
            path /var/log/httpd/*access*log
        }
        file {
            type syslog
            path /var/log/messages
        }
    }

then you can use one output for multiple inputs:

    output {
        redis {
            type apache-access-log, syslog
            key logstash
            host 127.0.0.1
        }
    }

In this case the redis-output is bound to the inputs 'apache-access-log'
and 'syslog', but if the log events are pushed to the output then the
type of the input is used for the json event. That means that '@type' is
set to the type of the input, not of the output.

# TODOS

* Does we really need another transports? Redis is so cool :-)
* Add proto udp to Input/Socket.pm and Output/Socket.pm.
